# Smithy Rust
Smithy code generators for Rust

## Setup
1. `./gradlew` will setup gradle for you
2. Running tests requires a working Rust installation. See [Rust docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) for 
installation instructions on your platform.

## Run tests 
```./tesh.sh```

This will run all the unit tests, codegen an example model end-to-end and validates that the generated code compiles.
